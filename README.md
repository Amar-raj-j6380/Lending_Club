# The-Lending-Club

I am currently enrolled at the New York City Data Science Academy.

For my fourth project (or capstone) with the Academy, I employ EDA and ML to assist the 3 main stakeholders that make up The LendingClub Marketplace. Through a variety of visualization and machine learning techniques, I demonstrate how data can be used to create a win-win-win situation.
